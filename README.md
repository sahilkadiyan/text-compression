# text-compression
Huffman’s algorithm takes a very simple idea and finds an elegant way to implement it.
At its heart is the observation that the more a thing is mentioned, the shorter its name should be.
This idea manifests itself in daily life too. For example, we use nicknames for people we call often, we have abbreviations for long words we often have to use and even the word ok was once an abbreviation for “all correct”
This is the implementation of the huffman algorithm . Basically huffman algorithm is a greedy algorithm which is used for compression of anything like text compression or image compression!!!
